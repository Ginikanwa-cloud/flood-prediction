## Project Topic: 
Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Occurrence of Flood.

## Data Set Description:
This data set is for flood

## Techniques:
In this project, I leveraged loading the dataset, cleaning the dataset, and splitting the dataset into two, one with a missing value and one without a missing value.
